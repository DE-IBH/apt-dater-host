apt-dater protocol 0.8
======================

This file documents the protocol between apt-dater and the
apt-dater-host command called via ssh on remote hosts. The protocol is
designed to be a generic package management interface and cover most
common GNU/Linux based package manager philosophies.


Hosts managed by apt-dater musst have the apt-dater-host command in
the search path.

User interactive commands (see below) will be shown to the user
unfiltered. Non-user interactive commands are parse by apt-dater.

Non-user interactive sessions must start with the protocol version:

    ADPROTO: ${ProtoVersion}

The current protocol version is 0.8. Example:

    ADPROTO: 0.8

If apt-dater-host detects an error (i.e. from the package manager)
during a non-interactive command it must add an error line containing
an user readable error message:

    ADPERR: ${Message}

The message string should not be empty.


Calling syntax
==============

An apt-dater-host script must accept the following command parameters:


refresh
-------

Updates the package list (i.e. apt-get update) and retrieve status
informations (see next command). This command is called none user
interactive.

If updating package list is not supported by the package manager the
script must return the same output like calling 'status'.


status
------

Prints status informations about installed distribution and packages.
This command is non user interactive.

There should be an LSB release line of the format:

    LSBREL: ${Distri}|{Version}|${Codename}

Example for Debian Etch:

    LSBREL: Debian|4.0|etch


There sould be PRL (Package Resource List) lines for the archive sources
the packaging system is using:

    PRL: ${URI}

The PRL lines must be in a normalized form (no unnecessary
spaces). There must be a PRL line for each archive source or no PRL
lines at all.

Example for Debian Squeezy:

    PRL: http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ squeezy main
    PRL: http://security.debian.org/ squeeze/updates main
    PRL: deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org squeeze main


A host might be part of one or more cluster (heartbeat,
drbd, ...). Cluster nodes should not be updated
simultanously. apt-dater will detect cluster nodes by identical
CLUSTER lines and avoid updating nodes of the same cluster
simultanously:

    CLUSTER: ${Cluster-A}
    CLUSTER: ${Cluster-B}

The cluster might be any ASCII string and must be identical on all
cluster nodes. A node can be part of multiple clusters.


There sould be an VIRTualization line of the format:

    VIRT: ${Name}

This will only work if the remote host has the imvirt(1) script
installed. Detected virtualizations:

  Microsoft Corporation / Virtual Machine:
    VIRT: Virtual Machine

  VMware, Inc. / VMware Virtual Platform:
    VIRT: VMware Virtual Platform

  QEMU or KVM:
    VIRT: QEMU

  Xen:
    VIRT: Xen

  non detected:
    VIRT: Physical

  imvirt not installed:
    VIRT: Unknown


There sould be an UNAME line of the format:

    UNAME: ${KERNEL-NAME}|${MACHINE}

The values are taken from the uname command:

    KERNEL-NAME: uname -s
    MACHINE    : uname -m


There must be a COMMANDS line of the format:

    COMMANDS: ${commands}

This is a bit-mask of supported apt-dater-host commands.  The commands
are represented by the following bits:

    0:  status
    1:	refresh
    2:	upgrade
    4:	(un)install
    8:  autoremove
   16:  (un)hold

These values are binary ORed. Default value is 7 if there is no
COMMANDS line. The bits of a legacy FORBID line (ADP <0.8) are removed
to support legacy versions.

The apt-dater-host script on the client will refuse commands not
marked as supported.


There should be an UUID line:

UUID: {$UUID}

This is the DCE 1.1, ISO/IEC 11578:1996 and RFC 4122 compliant
Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) of the host.  It should be a DCE
version 1 (time and node based) UUID, generated at the installation
time of the apt-dater-host client. This UUID is to be used to identify
the installation by inventory tools or other 3rd party software.


For each installed package there must be a status line:

    STATUS: ${Package}|${InstVersion}|${Status}|${SecurityUpdateVersion}...

    Supported Status values:
	i		: installed
	h		: hold back
	u=${NewVersion}	: update available
	x		: extra (no version found in any repository, this
			  might be an obsoleted package)
	b=${AddInfo}	: package is installed but broken
			  (i.e. not configured)

    Supported SecurityUpdateVersion values:
	s=${NewVersion}	: security update available

Example for an installed package:

    STATUS: g++-4.1|4.1.1-21|i

Example for an installed package with an update available:

    STATUS: dnsutils|1:9.3.4-2etch1|u=1:9.3.4-2etch3

Example for an installed package with both a regular update and a security
update available, of which the versions differ:

    STATUS: foo|1|u=2|s=1+deb9u1

There should be a kernel info line (see also 'kernel' command).


There should be NEEDRESTART line indicating the presence and the
version of the needrestart(1) script:

    NEEDRESTART-VER: ${Version}

needrestart(1) is called in batch mode printing informations about
services requiring restarts and outdated running kernels. The
definition of the lines prefixed with 'NEEDRESTART-' are defined by
the needrestart package. The following lines are currently known:

    NEEDRESTART-KCUR: ${running kernel version}
    NEEDRESTART-KEXP: ${expected kernel version}
    NEEDRESTART-KSTA: ${kernel status}
    NEEDRESTART-SVC: ${service}


upgrade
-------

Install all available upgrades, this is user interactive.


install [optional]
------------------

Install package(s) given as parameters to this command. This command
is user interactive.


uninstall [optional]
--------------------

Remove package(s) given as parameters to this command. This command
is user interactive.


kernel [optional]
-----------------

Retrieves informations about the running kernel. This command is non
user interactive.

The result line has the following format:

    KERNELINFO: ${Code} ${Release}

The following codes are supported:
    0 - The running kernel is the latest distri kernel. No reboot
	required.
    1 - The running kernel is an distri kernel but it's older then the
        latest installed. A reboot is recommended.
    2 - No distri kernel is running.
    9 - Unknown.

The release field should be the output of `uname -r`.


autoremove [optional]
---------------------

Removes package(s) that were automatically installed but are no longer
required to statisfy dependencies. This command is user interactive.


hold [optional]
---------------

Mark package(s) given as parameters to this command as 'hold'. The
current status informations about installed distribution and packages
are print after setting the package(s) on hold (like status). This
command is non user interactive.


unhold [optional]
-----------------

Mark package(s) given as parameters to this command no longer
as 'hold'. The current status informations about installed
distribution and packages are print after setting the package(s) on
hold (like status). This command is non user interactive.
