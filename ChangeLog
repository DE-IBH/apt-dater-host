apt-dater-host (0.9.0-adp0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-dater-host split-off
  * ADP 0.6:
     - cluster support
     - archive source support
  * Don't fail if apt-dater-host could not get the installed kernel packages;
    fallback to unknown reboot status.
    (Closes SF Bug#2991717 by Karoly Molnar)
  * Use $DPKGTOOL to detect packages with updates.

  * Fix unknown yum based hosts (reported on Fedora) due bad package status
    interpretation.
