apt-dater-host (0.9.x-adp0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some pedantic stuff (use long options for aptitude and apt-get to
    ease code reading). Don't fail on untrusted/unauthenticated packages
    when checking for upgrades (still check for the upgrade itself).
    (Contributed by Mathieu PARENT due SF Bug#3158198)
  * Check for updates (refresh) using dist-upgrade. This show
    ABI-incompatible upgrades (like the recent bind9 one:
    http://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2130.en.html).
    (Contributed by Mathieu PARENT due SF Bug#3158198)
  * Make upgrade method customizable and change default to dist-upgrade.
    (Inspired by Mathieu PARENT due SF Bug#3158198)
  * Allow apt-dater-host to be used with ssh keys.

apt-dater-host (0.9.0-adp0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-dater-host split-off
  * ADP 0.6:
     - cluster support
     - archive source support
  * Don't fail if apt-dater-host could not get the installed kernel packages;
    fallback to unknown reboot status.
    (Closes SF Bug#2991717 by Karoly Molnar)
  * Use $DPKGTOOL to detect packages with updates.
    (Contributed by Alexandre Anriot)
  * Fix unknown yum based hosts (reported on Fedora) due bad package status
    interpretation.
