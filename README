README for apt-dater-host
=========================

Setup hosts managed by apt-dater:

  You need a SSH server and sudo installed. Create a user which will
  be used to install updates (using root is NOT recommended).
  Modify the /etc/sudoers:

	Defaults env_reset,env_keep=MAINTAINER
	the-user ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get, /usr/bin/aptitude 

At your management server:

  Create a user on your management server which perform updates on your
  hosts.

  Generate a SSH keypair:
    ssh-keygen [..]

  Distribute the public key(s) e.g.:
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/your-public-key managed-host
